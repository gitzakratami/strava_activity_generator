Strava Activity Generator

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-orange.svg)

A sleek, dark-themed desktop application designed to quickly generate GPX files for manual Strava activities like gym workouts, yoga, or any GPS-less training. This tool eliminates the tedious process of adding activities one by one on the Strava website, allowing you to create and upload them in bulk.

Why This App Exists

Manually adding indoor or non-GPS activities to Strava can be a repetitive and time-consuming task. This application was built to solve that problem by providing a fast and intuitive interface to generate multiple activity files at once, which can then be batch-uploaded to Strava.

Features

Intuitive GUI: A clean, user-friendly interface built with PyQt6.

Strava-Themed Design: A dark mode aesthetic inspired by the Strava color palette.

Automatic Workout Numbering: The app remembers your last workout number and automatically suggests the next one.

Full Calendar View: Easily select the date of your workout from a persistent calendar.

Smart Date Advancement: Automatically jumps to the next typical training day (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday) after generating a file.

Organized Output: All generated GPX files are saved in a dedicated Strava Activity Generator folder in your Documents.

Quick Access: An "Open Folder" button gives you immediate access to your generated files.

Standalone & Installable: Can be run as a portable .exe or installed on Windows using a professional installer.

Installation

There are two ways to get the application.

1. For Regular Users (Recommended)
